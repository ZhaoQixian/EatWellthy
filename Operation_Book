1. Clone the whole repo into your either Git or Github desktop ( I use desktop and it looks easy after some tries)

2. Before you start, always pull to get the latest updated version from the team!!!

3. Go to the cloned repo in your laptop, it should be named as Github\EatWellthy

4. use your Laptop Powershell ( for windows)

5. I go for dinner and come back later haha
