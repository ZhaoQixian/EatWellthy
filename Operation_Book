1. Clone the whole repo into your either Git or Github desktop ( I use desktop Github app and it looks easy after some tries)

2. Before you start making any changes or just viewing, always fetch original to get the latest updated version from the team!!!

3. Go to the cloned repo in your laptop, it should be named as Github\EatWellthy

4. use your Laptop Powershell ( for windows )

5. Type in this line: cd WhereYouStoreTheProject\EatWellthy, or if u are using VS Code, click Terminal on the top bar        
                      e.g. cd "D:\Onedrive\Documents\GitHub\EatWellthy"
                      Copy the following code:

                      npm install mongoose
                      cd client
                      npm install
                      cd ../backend
                      npm start

7. The web app window should pop out from your default browser

8. After making changes, you can commit change and push to repo using github desktop app

9. Or you can delete the changes you make as long as you donot commit change, by right click the file you want to undo the changes
