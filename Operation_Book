1. Clone the whole repo into your either Git or Github desktop ( I use desktop Github app and it looks easy after some tries)

2. Before you start making any changes or just viewing, always fetch original to get the latest updated version from the team!!!

3. Go to the cloned repo in your laptop, it should be named as Github\EatWellthy

4. use your Laptop Powershell ( for windows )

5. Type in this line: cd WhereYouStoreTheProject\EatWellthy\backend         e.g. cd "D:\Onedrive\Documents\GitHub\EatWellthy\backend"
                      node --watch server

6. Open another Powershell window and 
   Type in this line: cd WhereYouStoreTheProject\EatWellthy\client          e.g. cd "D:\Onedrive\Documents\GitHub\EatWellthy\client"
                      $env:NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"         Only if you node.js version is >= V17
                      npm run start

7. The web app window should pop out from your default browser

8. After making changes, you can commit change and push to repo using github desktop app

9. Or you can delete the changes you make as long as you donot commit change, by right click the file you want to undo the changes
