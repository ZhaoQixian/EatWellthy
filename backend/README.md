- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user information, meal plans, and recipes
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB and data modeling
- **APIs**: Nutritionix, OpenAI, Google Maps, Google Calendar, Brevo, and Google OAuth for enhanced features and integrations

## üåê Live API Endpoints
**Base URL**: [`https://eatwellthy.onrender.com/api`](https://eatwellthy.onrender.com/api)

### Key Endpoints
- **Auth**: User authentication (sign up, login, logout) and Google OAuth 2.0 integration
- **Meal Planning**: Get and set meal plans based on nutritional data and user preferences

## üí° Development Workflow

### Regular Updates
Keep your repository up to date by fetching changes regularly:
```bash
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
```

### Branching and Committing
- Create a feature branch for any new features:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Commit and push:

## üì¶ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Database Connection**: Ensure the `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` is correct and that MongoDB is running.
- **API Limit**: Some APIs have daily limits; if hitting these limits, consider upgrading to a paid plan or monitoring usage.
- **Dependency Issues**: Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if there are peer dependency issues.
